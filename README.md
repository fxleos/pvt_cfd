###USER GUILD###

1. Open ‘pre_setup’, define and confirm all the parameters, run it

2. Run ‘hydraulic_simulation’

3. Run ‘thermal_simulation’

4. Run ‘electric_simulation’

5. Run ‘write journal’, if you want to save the results into journal files

*To run the script program in MATLAB, you can either enter the filename (e.g. ‘pre_setup’ in command window and then press ‘ENTER’ or open it in editor window and click ‘RUN’ bottom in the tool bars
